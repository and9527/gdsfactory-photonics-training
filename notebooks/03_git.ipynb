    "*Note:* While it's a good idea to understand the basics of fixing merge conflicts by hand, in some cases you may find the use of an automated tool useful.  Git supports multiple [merge tools](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-mergetool.html): a merge tool is a piece of software that conforms to a basic interface and knows how to merge two files into a new one.  Since these are typically graphical tools, there are various to choose from for the different operating systems, and as long as they obey a basic command structure, git can work with any of them."
